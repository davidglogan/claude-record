## Overview
Implemented REST API authentication endpoint with JWT token support
and added comprehensive test suite covering both happy paths and error cases.

## Tasks Completed
- Created /api/auth/login endpoint with email/password validation
- Implemented JWT token generation and validation middleware
- Added bcrypt password hashing with appropriate cost factor
- Created comprehensive test suite with 15 test cases
- Updated API documentation with authentication flow

## Key Decisions & Insights
- Chose JWT over sessions for stateless authentication approach
- Set access token expiry to 24 hours with refresh token support
- Used bcrypt with cost factor 12 for password hashing (security vs performance balance)
- Implemented two-token approach (access + refresh) for better UX

## Files Modified
- `/src/api/auth.py` - New authentication endpoint implementation
- `/src/middleware/jwt.py` - Token validation middleware
- `/tests/test_auth.py` - Comprehensive test suite
- `/docs/api.md` - Updated authentication documentation

## Technologies/Topics
`python`, `flask`, `jwt`, `authentication`, `api-design`, `testing`, `bcrypt`, `security`

## Context for Future Reference
The authentication system uses a two-token approach (access + refresh).
Access tokens expire in 24 hours, refresh tokens in 30 days. The refresh
token is stored in an httpOnly cookie for security. Password reset
functionality is planned for next sprint. The bcrypt cost factor of 12
provides good security while keeping login times under 500ms.

## Follow-up Items
- [ ] Implement password reset flow with email verification
- [ ] Add rate limiting to login endpoint (prevent brute force)
- [ ] Setup email verification for new account registrations
- [ ] Add OAuth2 support for Google/GitHub login
